<h1>Goals for 2016</h1>

<h6>:bulb: <i>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/una/personal-goals">Una Kravetz's Open Source Goals</a></i></h6>

This is a place for me to list my goals and accomplishments. Since these goals are open source, I'm hoping that I will be encouraged to finish my goals every month. I have 'Big Goals' and 'Monthly Goals', but this format may change as the year progresses.

<br>

<h2>Big Goals for 2016</h2>
* Learn as much as I can about PHP & Laravel
  - watch at least one Laracast vid per week
  - practice building Laravel & PHP apps in downtime
* Rebuild my Personal Website (combination of portfolio, resume & blog posts)
  - focus on making the website easy to navigate & minimal
  - create a simple Wordpress theme that can be easily modified in the future
  - transfer over only things of note (probably not blog posts)
* Focus on maintaining my health (mental, physical, etc.)
  - remember to relax & breathe
  - remember to listen to what your body is telling you

<br>

<h2>Monthly</h2>
* Read (at least) 1 book a month
* Watch (at least) 1 movie a month
* Try something new
  - (this is way too broad & either needs to be changed or deleted altogether)
* Build a Thing
* Reflect at the end of the month
