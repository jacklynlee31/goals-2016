<h4>Weekly Review:</h4> I accomplished most of the things I set out to do this week. I need to start focusing in on Laravel, so I need to wrap up the PHP video as a foundation and get started on the other Laracasts. I also want to keep chipping away at my 'Things to Remember' GitBook - I've already been using it as a reference during projects. Finally, my new project, 'Do the Thing' is finally at home on GitHub. It's a simple app that I discussed with a friend of mine. I'm mostly using it to practice Laravel. I need to get used to starting Laravel projects and building a good foundation for everything I do.
