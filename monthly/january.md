:ballot_box_with_check: <b>Build a Thing</b>: I'm doing some side work for a friend of mine's small business, and they needed a price scale for their website. It needed to reflect different amounts as the user dragged the slider left & right. It actually came out pretty good. Just need a few fixes here and there. Also reminded me how rusty my javaScript & jQuery is...

<h2>Reflection</h2>
January was interesting. Through starting this project I learned what I focus on and why. I learned what distracts me and what keeps me focused. I completed everything on my list except for reading a book. I thought it would be one of the easier items on my list, but I kept putting it off in lieu of other things. I may have to go back and edit the original list. Or, who knows, the list could be totally different from month to month. Spending more time focusing on learning new things, whether it be through watching more coding videos, creating new side projects, or reading a new book, are the things that need to be important.
